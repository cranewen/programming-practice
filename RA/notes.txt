"New" button doesn't have to submit information. It can redirect to createRA.php, then once submit from createRA.php, it creates a new RA with an auto increased number(Index).
"New" button creates a new session and a new row in database, so once the database generates the index automatically, the number will be the session's name($_SESSION['name']). This process is in order to insert other data to the RA that has been created, so it won't create a new row in database.

addingproducts.php get the submission from createRA.php, inserting(create) a row in mysql as a new RA. Then addingproducts.php allows you add products to the RA you just created.

resubmission issue.

****** very important ******
echo '<th><a href="singlerarecord.php?ra=' .$row['ra_number'].'">', $row['ra_number'],'</a></th>'; ------> In this statement, ra=xxx, here the ra is a GET parameter, so the next page will be able to retreive data from $_GET['ra'];

Thoughts:
This may not be an effcient way to list all the products, than links to each details, but it works.(Probably good for small data projects.)
